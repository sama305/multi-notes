# Better Notes
**Note: This is a plugin for the [RuneLite OSRS Client](https://runelite.net/).**

_Better Notes_ adds a simple and powerful note editor that has note organization **baked in**.

## Features
* Simple text editing
* Separate _notes_ for separate _thoughts_
* Automatic header/title recognition

I was tired of manually organizing my "notes" on the official note plugin and I had many ideas for how to improve it, so I spent a day making this plugin. I hope you enjoy and find it as useful as I do. Thank you as well to the official note plugin for acting as a nice reference.
